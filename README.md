## üí´ Impact Story

### Story of Hope ‚Äì How One Sewing Machine Changed Rani's Life

When Rani, a 29-year-old woman from a small slum area near Indore, first heard about Orbosis Foundation's Skill Development Workshop, she almost didn't come. She thought ‚Äî 'People like us never get real help.'

Rani was a single mother. Her husband had left, and she worked as a domestic helper, earning barely enough to feed her two children. Most days, she skipped her own meals to make sure her kids ate.

One day, her neighbor told her about Orbosis Foundation's training sessions for women who wanted to learn tailoring and basic business skills. With hesitation, she joined ‚Äî nervous, shy, and full of doubt.

But over the next few months, everything changed. Rani learned how to stitch, manage orders, and even use a smartphone to take online tailoring work. She received her first sewing machine through the foundation's support program.

The day she earned her first ‚Çπ500 from her own work, she cried ‚Äî not because of the money, but because for the first time, she felt free.

Today, Rani runs her small tailoring unit from home. She not only supports her children's education but also trains other women in her area for free every Sunday.

"Orbosis Foundation didn't just teach me a skill," Rani says. "They taught me that I have the power to stand on my own feet."
